== 1.7.2

  Release Notes:
  
  RightAws includes some new features, including:

    We now reset the seek pointer of the streaming IO object to its initial position.
  - Removal of an accidental dependency on ActiveSupport in RightAws::S3Interface.get_link().
  - Monkey-patch of the Ruby File class on Windows platforms to correct a problem in lstat.

  volumes, and list the available volumes and snapshots.

  Bug fixes include correction of RightAws::S3 copy's failure to url-encode
the source key.
